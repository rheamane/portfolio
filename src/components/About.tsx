        <p className="font-serif">
          I recently graduated Summa Cum Laude with a B.S. in Computer Science
          with Honors from Arizona State University, and I&apos;m currently
          pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science. With school, I am also working
          as an Application Developer Intern at the W.P. Carey School of
          Business, where I contribute to the development of Advising SOSâ€”a
          flagship application designed to support students and academic
          advisors.

          I&apos;ve gained hands-on experience through internships at Ricoh USA
          and Drive Insight LLC, working on Agile process optimization, web
          application development, and user-centric UI/UX design. I thrive in
          collaborative environments and enjoy applying my technical skills to
          solve real-world problems. Beyond my coursework and work experience,
          I&apos;ve led multiple projects, including developing issue ticketing
          systems, healthcare web apps, and productivity tools. I&apos;m
          passionate about learning new technologies and am always excited to
          take on new challenges in web development, software engineering, and
          data-driven solutions. Let&apos;s connect!
